# Enrollege Project

Enrollege is an AI-powered system that helps students find universities and courses appropriate for them based on their preferred courses, maximum tuition budget, and gender. The courses are either WAEC or NECO, but the system can be extended later to cater to SAT for students hoping to broaden their horizon. This project was created by a team of developers who wanted to build something unique that has the potential to scale beyond their program.

## Purpose

The Enrollege project was inspired by the major challenge students face when deciding on the right path for their lives. Our aim is to simplify the process and help students find the right universities and courses that are appropriate for them based on their preferences.

## Technologies

The Enrollege project was built using HTML, jQuery, Flask, CSS, and Python. We chose these technologies because they are robust, widely used, and have excellent support for web development.

## Architecture

The architecture of the Enrollege project is straightforward. The frontend was built using HTML, CSS, and jQuery, while the backend was built using Python and Flask. We used jQuery to make API requests to the backend server, which would then process the request and return a response to the frontend.

## Features

We have completed several features for the Enrollege project, including:

- User authentication via email and password
- User input for preferred courses, maximum tuition budget, and gender
- API endpoint for retrieving universities and courses based on user input

## Challenges

One of the most challenging aspects of the Enrollege project was finding a relevant dataset to use for our recommendations. We had to collate data from various sources and decide on the best way to integrate it into our system. Additionally, designing the visual elements and implementing them posed another challenge.

## Learnings

Working on the Enrollege project taught us several valuable lessons about technical interests, including:

- The importance of data collection and analysis
- The power of collaboration in achieving project goals
- The value of planning and setting achievable milestones
